# Arduino-Temperature-Reading
Using an Arduino to read temperature readings from a sensor via SMBus protocol

This device uses 16 sensors addressed from 1-16 and 3 LEDs as visual outputs

For Arduino Uno and Mega: Use master branch and I2C Library

For Arduino Nano 33BLE: Use WireLib branch and Wire Library
